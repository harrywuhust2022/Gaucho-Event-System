# Introduction of Gaucho Event System

What I have completed so far:
* We have a login / sign up / log out page;
* All users with their events are shown in the main page;
* All the authenticated users can CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) their events.

What's next?
* Comment functions on the events.
