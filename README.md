# Gaucho-Event-System
Group Project for CS291A, Fall 2023. [Details](https://cs291.com/project/). And the team Members are Sahil Naik, Rutvik Jha, Kai Han, Kedai Zuo and Qiming Wu.

## Requirements:
We are building an "Event Sharing Service" and the basic models are defined as follows:
* Event
* RSVP
* Comment
* User
* Invite

Based on the models, we have the following user stories:
* As an unauthenticated user, I can create an event so that I can share with others the details of the event I am hosting;
* As an unauthenticated user, I can comment on an event to share my enthusiasm for said event;
* As an authenticated user, I can RSVP yes/no to events that I do [not] intend to attend so that the host can better estimate how many people will show up;
* As an authenticated user, I can see the list of events that I have previously attended so that I can recall my fond memories;
* As an event host, I can proactively invite users to my event, so that I can help spread the word.

## Progress:
For week 1, we plan to assign 2 people to finish the environment setup and AWS deployment. After that, another 2 people will finish the backend user stories. The remaining members are learning react for later frontend developments.
